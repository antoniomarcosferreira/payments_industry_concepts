# Fraud Detection

This project will help you understand better how the payments industry works.

And shows some examples of fraud detection, implemented in Ruby on Rails, Python and Rust.

## Documentation

Here we can better understand the concepts and definitions of the authors in financial transactions involving cards.


**[Payment Industry Concepts](docs/README.md)**


## IA


To use AI here, I first want to study the data more and do tests using the Python language, which is simpler to do the tests.

So only after having a well-tested model, just use the same concept in Ruby on Rails and Rust. Because these languages ​​also have resources for ML.
